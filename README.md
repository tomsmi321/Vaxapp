### Purpose
#### Made for parents all over Victoria, VicVax makes the whole process of knowing when to vaccinate your child much simpler. The essential purpose of VicVax is for a parent to be presented with a list of all vaccinations neccessary for that parents child between the ages of 0 - 12 months. Users can also add mulitple children, remove a reminder once completed which then moves it to the completed vaccination list for that child. All of which is very easy to view through our Main Menu.

------

### Functionality

#### The parent will be presented with a "Create Your Account" menu and once selected will ask the parent for the childs name & age. From there our "Main Menu" feature will appear.

#### Once you've reached the "Main Menu" you will be asked to select one of the 4 options. From there the parents are able to view reminders on which vaccinations are needed for their child, view all completed vaccinations, Add a new child and then exiting the app.

### Once Parents have created a child and have asked to view reminders they are then able to remove reminders which then pushes it into the completed vaccination list for that child

### Due to the apps ease to use, parents of all ages will be able to seemlessly use it to help a real world problem

### Design and Planning
We decided to create a diagram/storyboard to clearly mark what we needed to get done.

### Time Management:
#### Trello was a big help with being able to write down and describe what we need to do to achieve a minimum viable product (MVP). As well as helping us with finishing off all added features we thought of and aided us with the documentation of the entire project.

### Project Plan & Timeline
#### The scope for VicVax's build was two-three days. We first needed to figure out how we were going to go about building it, which we did through making a storyboard & diagram of all the classes we initially needed to build the app. Due to the limited time we knew time management was vital for completion of successful app, so using certain applications such as Trello to help keep track of where we were at throught the project.

#### Day 1 was about planning before begining the programming, and from the momemnt we began we came up with a strategy on Trello of how to go about building our app. We wrote down all of the classes using a diagram on LucidChart we'd initially need to get a mvp for VicVax. Followed by beginning the code and making all the classes for the app.

#### Day 2 was trying to follow the planning we did from day 1 and finishing off all classes/methods and try to have a mvp. Once we completed that it was making touch ups through-out the code to make the code more modular as well as adding finishing touches.

#### By closing following the planning we did we were able to follow a timeline which allowed us to work together and present a product which overall made it feel like out time was always spent effectively and efficiently.

------

### Challenges:
1. User being able to add more than one child
2. Making code more modular

------

### Future Enhancements:
1. Use exact dates rather than months
2. Create a read and write file to save users info beyond a single session
3. Use API to alert users of outbreaks in their area
4. Add a login section where user can create account with email/password
